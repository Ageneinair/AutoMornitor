Description: # VideoCut
        Version 0.0.1

        VideoCut is a python package builted based on OpenCV.
        
          - Cut down a video more easily
          - Convert the frame rate (frames per second) arbitrarily
        
        ### Instructions
        The syntax of `videocut()` is:
        
        ```py
            videocut(start, end, output_fps, input_address, output_address='cuted_video.mp4')
        ```
        `start` and `end` are the starting point and ending pnint seperately of the piece which you want from the original video in the term of second; `output_fps` is a parameter to determine frames per second of the output video (if the 'output_fps' is smaller than original fps, the redundant frames would be deleted and the time span of the output video would be `end`-`start`); `input_address` is the address of input video; `output_address` is the address of input video and it is default as creating a video file named `cuted_video.mp4` in the root directory
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install From package installer for Python (pip).
